# Campaign-in-Multiplayer mod for WZ
This is a mod for Warzone 2100 (https://github.com/Warzone2100/warzone2100) done simply by copying the campaign stats and making a research tree out of it.
Feel free to make an issue if you found a technology is disconnected (cannot be obtained by following the research tree of this mod but can be obtained in campaign)
